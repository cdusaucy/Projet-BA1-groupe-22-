"""This is a simplistic Path Detector.

    A Path Detector module is a python file that contains a `detect` function
    that is capable of analyzing a binarized image in which non-zero pixels
    indicate road boundaries. The analysis should identify the path (or,
    multiple paths) to follow.

    See the description of the `detect` function below for more details.

    This Simplistic Path Detector implements a first crude idea to path
    detection, and needs ample modification in order to obtain a working
    prototype.

    In this Simplistic Path Detector, a path is detected by sampling a single
    row towards the bottom of the image. Non-zero pixels are identified to
    infer the road between the car center and the road center is calculated and
    used as the path to follow. """

    """This function receives a binarized image in its `mask` argument
    (`mask` is a h x w  numpy array where h is the height and w the width).
    The non-zero pixels in the array encode road boundaries.

    The task of this function is to analyze the mask, and identify the path
    that the car should follow.

      `dict` is a dictionary that is transmitted to the state machine
           it should contain all the information that the state machine
           requires to actuate the identified path(s).
           Implementors are free to encode this information in the dictionary
           in any way that they like. Of course, the state machine needs to
           be written correspondingly to correctly decode the information.

      `img` is optionally a numpy array (of the same width and height
            as the mask) that visualizes the found path. Used for
            visualization in the viewer only.
